# o1.lib

C++ library with:
* Containers (list, stack, queue, hash table).
  * node elements are embedded in the contained object,
    which gets detached/removed from the container when
    they are destroyed.
* numeric types (int & float/double in all sizes) to & from
  string conversions.
* & more.

This is a work in progress, basically for fun & to be used in
my own personal projects.
